# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The Amazon Vine Program is an invite-only program offered to Amazon customers with top review ratings. Due to the exclusivity of the program, it bring about the question of whether there's a bias towards customers who are in the Vine program to giving more 5-star reviews than customers who arent't in the Vine program. This analysis looks at Amazon reviews for major appliances to see if Vine customers give more 5 star reviews than customers who aren't in the Amazon Vine program.
## Results
* In the Major Appliance reviews, there were 4,957 reviews from customers not in the Vine program. Of those 4,957 reviews, there were 1,963 5-star reviews. This accounted for 39.6% of all of the reviews.

## Summary
Based on the analysis of Major Appliance reviews, there does seem to be a positivity bias among Amazon Vine customers. Over half of the reviews (51.43%) given by Amazon Vine customers were 5-star reviews as opposed to 31.6% from Amzaon customers not in the Vine program. To see how far this positivity bias goes, an analysis could be done to see the percentage of reviews in three different rating buckets: positive (4-5 stars), neutral (3 stars) and negative (1-2 stars).
